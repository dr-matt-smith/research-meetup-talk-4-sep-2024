# research-meetup-talk-4-sep-2024

Provisional plan for the hour (we’ll finish at around 1.50pm so everyone has time to be somewhere else at 2pm)

- Quick intro about the initial aims of the lunchtime sessions (we hope this is the first of many…)
  - And you can suggest events / goals for these sessions too … such events are BY school researchers FOR school researchers – so whatever we want them to be …
- Several (around 3) researchers to give lightening “3-minute” talk about their work / a topic related to their work (so about 20 mins including speaker changeovers)
- Agree date / time / location details for the next lunch session
- Agree provisional agenda for next session
- form a simple committee for next 2 events
  - an informal team to send out emails / confirm speakers / confirm agenda etc. current plan is people help out with 2 events then pass the baton to the next people 
this isn’t a lot of work, and we’ll share it around via volunteers
